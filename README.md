# busybox-iso

#Shell Script to make a very small Linux ISO with busybox.

This script will most likely not work the first few times it is run, and I can't do anything about this. Many packageges required for compiling the kernel will probably be missing. Commonly missing packages are - build-essential(debian) / base-devel(arch) - bc - libssl - flex - libelf-dev. MANY DISTOS HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES FOR PACKAGES, SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR YOUR DISTO.
